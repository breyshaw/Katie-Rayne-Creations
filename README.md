# Katie-Rayne-Creations

Katie-Rayne-Creations is custom clothing, tumbler, and craft site for my wife's small business.

Katie Rayne Creations was developed as a full CRUD, MEN Stack application. The site is centered around the navigation bar. Each category/button on the navigation bar has established routes and views. The item controller contains all of the controller functions that render categorized items on the corresponding category view when a navigation button is clicked.
